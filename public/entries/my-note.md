In the early period of adaptation to a new environment in which an immigrant begins to communicate most of the time using a non-native language, negative changes in cognitive abilities appear. The factor is the inability to express oneself with the help of a still weak toolkit of a foreign language. In this early period, due to the need to use a foreign language most of the time, the immigrant begins to think in two languages ​​in turn or mixed. If the knowledge of the language is significantly lower than the native, a person during the thought process uses simplified alternatives, which subsequently lead either to a longer logical conclusion, or begin to lead him on a false trail.
